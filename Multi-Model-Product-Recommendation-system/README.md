Creating a multimodal product recommendation system as you've described involves a combination of vision and language models, typically using CLIP or similar architectures to handle both image and textual data. Here's how you can proceed:

### 1. Dataset
You can use publicly available datasets with both product images and textual descriptions, such as:

- **Amazon Product Reviews**: Includes reviews, product titles, categories, and images. Some versions include additional metadata such as user behavior.
  - [Amazon Product Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
  
- **DeepFashion Dataset**: Contains product images along with associated attributes, useful for clothing recommendations.
  - [DeepFashion on CVPR](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html)

- **FashionGen**: A dataset containing fashion images and detailed textual descriptions, which is perfect for building vision-language models.
  - [FashionGen Dataset](https://fashion-gen.com/)

These datasets can be used for training the multimodal recommendation model.

### 2. Code Implementation
I'll guide you through the basic setup of a multimodal recommendation engine using CLIP for image and text embeddings. Below is a simplified version of the pipeline using PyTorch and CLIP.

#### Step 1: Install Dependencies
First, you need to install some libraries:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision transformers
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
```

#### Step 2: Loading CLIP Model
You will load CLIP to create image and text embeddings.
```python
import torch
import clip
from PIL import Image

# Load the model
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model, preprocess = clip.load("ViT-B/32", device=device)

# Preprocess an image
image = preprocess(Image.open("path_to_image.jpg")).unsqueeze(0).to(device)

# Prepare text
texts = clip.tokenize(["A product description here", "Another product description"]).to(device)

# Compute image and text embeddings
with torch.no_grad():
    image_features = model.encode_image(image)
    text_features = model.encode_text(texts)

# Normalize embeddings
image_features /= image_features.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
text_features /= text_features.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)

# Compute similarity between image and text
similarity = (image_features @ text_features.T).squeeze(0)
print("Similarity score:", similarity)
```

#### Step 3: Building the Recommendation Engine
You can retrieve products based on similarity between their visual and textual embeddings. Here's a simplified approach using nearest neighbors for cross-modal retrieval.

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

# Store image and text embeddings
all_image_embeddings = []  # Populate this with your dataset
all_text_embeddings = []  # Populate this with your dataset

# Use NearestNeighbors for cross-modal retrieval
knn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=5, metric="cosine").fit(all_image_embeddings)

# Retrieve top-5 text matches for an image query
distances, indices = knn.kneighbors(image_features.cpu().numpy())

# Print out the closest textual matches
for i in indices[0]:
    print("Recommended product:", product_descriptions[i])
```

#### Step 4: User Interface for Transparency
For the user interface, you can build a simple React Native frontend with Expo, and display product images and recommendations using a combination of text descriptions and visual data.

In the app, you can use React Native components like `FlatList` to display the recommended products alongside the reasoning behind the recommendations (i.e., similarity scores).

### Step 5: Training the Model (Optional)
If you wish to fine-tune the model on your specific product dataset, you can consider using a contrastive loss on image-text pairs to align their embeddings more effectively. You could also leverage additional frameworks like Hugging Face's `transformers` to train the model on your dataset.
